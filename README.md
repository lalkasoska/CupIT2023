# General information
Our team participated in the CupIT competition in which we had to develop a language model for comment ranking in a social network. We were given a dataset with posts, where each post contains a post's text and texts of four comments to it. The comments were sorted by their rating. We conducted an EDA and decided to train DistilBERT for this task.
<br /><br />
We used Pyhton3 and Google Collab for this task. We used such modules as:<br />

- sklearn<br />
- nltk<br />
- numpy<br />
- pandas<br />
- transformers<br /> 
- pytorch<br />
- matplotlib<br />
- json<br />
- textblob<br />
- textstat<br />
- spellchecker<br />

After training the model acheived NDCG metric value of 0.88.
